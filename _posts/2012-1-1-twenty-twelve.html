<h1>Twenty Twelve</h1>
<h2>A fresh site for fresh sight</h2>

<p>
	There is a lot to be excited about going in to a new year in any field, but the soil of
	science seems particularly fertile at this time. We get ever closer to the Higgs Boson, personal exome sequencing, square kilometer telescope arrays, vaccines for malaria and AIDS, patient autonomy, pervasive open data, better metrics and a modern peer review process.
</p>

<p> Running through
	each discipline, through each institute, through each research group and their constituent
	parts are a collection of common tools, patterns and lines of thought which are propelling the
	business of science forward.
<p>
<p>
	This site reflects this excitement. Through the lens of technology, we'll review the state of the art of perfecting the scientific method. So through 2012 and beyond, I hope you can join us.
</p>
<p>
	Happy New Year.
